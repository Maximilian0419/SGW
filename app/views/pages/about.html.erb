  <p> Jason Davis, founder and operator of Green Wheels, has been in the automotive industry since 1996.   After moving to California from the Chicago-land area, Jason's passion for cars has become more clear, and definitely more green.  Providing a safe and clean environment has become a priority, not just for his family, but for his community at large.  By combining his experience and devotion with existing technology,  the idea for Green Wheels, a specialty car-dealership focusing on energy-efficient, pre-driven vehicles was born. </p>
  <p> As a Pontiac and BMW dealer, Jason has vast experience with some incredible muscle cars such as the Trans Am, M3, and M5; now boasting over 560 horsepower.  In pushing the threshold of power, factories and engineers strived toward the mindset "can we do it," never pausing to think "SHOULD WE DO IT."  Today, after 50 years of premier power-launches, there is a price to pay. </p>
  <p> The "inconvenient truth" is here and now!  The world is changing.  Smog and pollution are at critical levels and consumer apathy is making matters worse.  Driving an environmentally friendly vehicle is not a fad and you do not need to be an environmentalist to sit behind the wheel.  Owning a "pollution solution," provides potential tax benefits and, of course, much lower payments to the gas-pumps.  Green Wheels will find the best, energy-efficient vehicles available in the market at a competitive price, and will make certain that they are inspected to super-high standards.  One car at a time, we can truly make a difference. </p>
